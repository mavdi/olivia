Simple blog based on node.js.

## Features:

* Very simple functionality. 
* Easy to customise. Just change the template files.
* Markdown support.

## Reuirements

Tested on node.js v0.6.2 and express 3.0.0
Uses bcrypt, kiwi, marked, mongoose, session-mongoose and connect-mongo. (I should probably just add a packages.json).
